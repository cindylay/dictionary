# Python Dictionary Classifier

This project uses Object Oriented Programming in Python to identify if two text inputs are written by the same author. This is an extremely simple version of a Naive Bayes Classifier. Given two texts, the classifier will detect similarities in terms of words and punctuation. All code can be found in the master branch.

You can test out this out with your own text files by cloning the git repository and placing your files them in your local directory. Update the readfromFile()s at the bottom of final.py with your own text file names. There are also demo files provided in this repository.
